# shell terminal ping pong

Source the pong.sh script in your bash shell to start a "ping pong game" between your shell and terminal.
It works by binding a command to the response of the terminal to an escape sequence.
The command prints ping/pong and triggers the terminal again.

```bash
. ./pong.sh
```
